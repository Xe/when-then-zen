Feature: The Quantum Pause
  The Quantum Pause is a meditative technique that serves as a very convenient
  tool for reaching a special space of neutrality and intention from which you
  can work on whatever youâ€™d like internally. It is designed to reach a space 
  of contact with your inmost self, allowing you to work through situations by 
  their wisdom, and reinforcing their presence in the life of the individual.
  
  A longer introduction to this process is here: [The Quantum Pause Breathing Exercise](https://web.archive.org/web/20121224082813/http://wespenre.com/pdf/Appendix-cognitive-section-quantum-pause-breathing-exercise.pdf)
  
  At a high level this is metta mixed with box breathing mixed with mindfulness.
  
  The purpose of this exercise is not to leave the body, have a "spiritual"
  experience, or even to conjure any "positive" experience when you are finished.
  It is not designed to create an experience of your mind or give you 
  visualizations of another world. If you feel, sense or experience anything
  that is unrelated to your purpose: gently, but firmly remove it.
  
  Some people may find that the pause after the out-breath causes a sense of
  panic. If you feel this happen, pause for a shorter amount of time. I have
  found this works best when you breathe ALL the way in (until you can't) and
  ALL the way out (until you can't). Play around with the process.
  
  As used in this feature, the I AM is the feeling of being infinite and
  sovereign. The WE ARE is the feeling of connectedness, wholeness, equality,
  and integration of all other beings and life. These are optional, but I have
  found they help immensely.
  
  Background:
    Given no background in meditation
    And a willingness to learn
    And no immediate problems breathing through the body's nose
    And I am seated or laying down comfortably
    And no music is playing
    
  Scenario Outline: declarative purpose
    # tl;dr: declare your intent before the first breath
    As a meditator
    In order to start this process
    When I have a purpose in mind
    Then I declare it aloud, saying "<intent>".
    
    Examples:
      | intent                                           |
      | I am doing this for the whole of humanity.       |
      | I am doing this for myself.                      |
      | I am doing this for my friends.                  |
      | I am doing this for my family.                   |
      | I am doing this for the readers of this article. |
      
  Scenario: breathing cycle
    # Avoid the temptation to visualize, think or feel anything. Just let it
    # happen without comment.
    As a meditator
    In order to bring myself into the Now
    When I begin
    Then I breathe in through the body's nose until I cannot anymore
    Then I pause for a moment # the I AM
    Then I exhale through the body's mouth until I cannot anymore
    Then I pause for a moment # the WE ARE
    Then I continue for two to four measures # trust your gut
    
  Scenario Outline: consolidation
    As a meditatior
    In order to consolidate things
    When I notice things bubble up
    Then I take a fresh look at them
    And decide what I want to do with them
    Then I perform <action>
    Then I repeat this for a few minutes # (3 to 5-ish, don't take these as hard numbers)
    Then I use my intuition to guide
    
    Examples:
      | action                          |
      | simple awareness and acceptance |
      | loving-kindness (metta)         |
      | conflict resolution techniques  |
      | appreciation                    |
      | compassion                      |
      | forgiveness                     |
      | humility                        |
      | valor                           |
      | understanding                   |
    
  Scenario: meditation session
    As a meditator
    In order to perform a Quantum Pause session
    Given I have a comfortable space
    And I have some time to myself
    Then I start with the declarative purpose
    Then I do 2-4 measures of the breathing cycle
    Then I consolidate
    Then I repeat the breathing cycle and consolidation a few times
    Then I thank the session for happening
    Then I end it
