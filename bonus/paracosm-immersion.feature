Feature: Paracosm Immersion
  A paracosm (also known as a mental wonderland) is a kind of thoughtspace
  that you can create, control and immerse yourself into. It is a lot less hard
  to create and immerse yourself into than people expect, almost deceptively so.
  
  The method explained in this document is roughly based on literal philosophical
  metaphysical analysis (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics), or in
  simpler terms: to answer the following two questions with as much detail and
  as generally as possible.
  
  1. What is _there_?
  2. What is _it like_?
  
  The method used here is a combination of a sensory grounding technique and
  something I found to help mitigate feelings of aphasia. The parts of this
  technique can be thusly taken out of the context of this exercise and used
  to either help you ground yourself or for helping you feel like you can 
  visualize and experience things better. 
  
  It's really not hard unless you make it hard. Make it easy and it will be 
  trivial. I have been noting my progress here: [ma-insa â€” Write.as](https://write.as/ma-insa/)

  Background:
    Given you have a mental world in mind
    Or an image of what you would like to experience
    And are willing to let the sensations of that world overwhelm you
    And have some time to yourself
    And you have some writing device # punt if this distracts you
  
  Scenario: picking somewhere in the space
    As a visitor of that world 
    In order to get an idea of where you want to go
    When you pick a place
    Then keep it in mind as you go forward
  
  Scenario: grounding
    As a visitor of that world in the location you picked
    In order to help ground yourself into that world
    When you take in the sensations that would make sense for it
    Then you note five things you can see
    Then you note four things you can hear
    Then you note three things you can touch
    Then you note two things you can smell
    Then you note one thing you can taste
    Then you note additional sensory reactions to things as they come into your focus
    
  Scenario: feature analysis for random things you noted
    As a visitor of that world in the location you picked
    In order to get more detail in mind about some random thing you noted
    When you focus on that thing in particular
    Then you note what group or category that thing is in
    Then you note what common uses exist for that thing
    Then you note what inherent actions are common for that thing
    Then you note what properties that thing has
    Then you note what the most common location for that thing is
    Then you note any other associations that come up when thinking about that thing
    Then you repeat this a few times as makes sense
    
  Scenario: daily practice
    As someone who wants to immerse in a mental world
    In order to help train this skill
    When you are planning your day # I personally find it helps the most in the morning
    Then add some time for this practice 
    Then (if it helps) set a timer to help limit your sessions # I use 30 minutes maximum
    Then pick a place you want to immerse yourself into
    Then ground yourself in that place
    Then describe a few things using feature analysis
    Then (if it helps) put your notes into a blog or diary of some kind
