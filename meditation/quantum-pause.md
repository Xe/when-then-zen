# Feature: The Quantum Pause

The Quantum Pause is a meditative technique that serves as a very convenient
tool for reaching a special space of neutrality and intention from which you
can work on whatever you’d like internally. It is designed to reach a space 
of contact with your inmost self, allowing you to work through situations by 
their wisdom, and reinforcing their presence in the life of the individual.

A longer introduction to this process is [here](http://wespenre.com/pdf/Appendix-cognitive-section-quantum-pause-breathing-exercise.pdf)

At a high level this is metta mixed with box breathing mixed with mindfulness.

The purpose of this exercise is not to leave the body, have a "spiritual"
experience, or even to conjure any "positive" experience when you are finished.
It is not designed to create an experience of your mind or give you 
visualizations of another world. If you feel, sense or experience anything
that is unrelated to your purpose: gently, but firmly remove it.

Some people may find that the pause after the out-breath causes a sense of
panic. If you feel this happen, pause for a shorter amount of time. I have
found this works best when you breathe ALL the way in (until you can't) and
ALL the way out (until you can't). Play around with the process.

As used in this feature, the I AM is the feeling of being infinite and
sovereign. The WE ARE is the feeling of connectedness, wholeness, equality,
and integration of all other beings and life. These are optional, but I have
found they help immensely.

## Background:

> Given no background in meditation  
> And a willingness to learn  
> And no immediate problems breathing through the body's nose  
> And I am seated or laying down comfortably  
> And no music is playing

## Scenario Outline: declarative purpose

> As a meditator  
> In order to start this process  
> When I have a purpose in mind  
> Then I declare it aloud, saying "$intent".
    
tl;dr: declare your intent before the first breath
    
### Examples:

| intent                                           |
| :----------------------------------------------- |
| I am doing this for the whole of humanity.       |
| I am doing this for myself.                      |
| I am doing this for my friends.                  |
| I am doing this for my family.                   |
| I am doing this for the readers of this article. |

## Scenario: breathing cycle

> As a meditator  
> In order to bring myself into the Now  
> When I begin  
> Then I breathe in through the body's nose until I cannot anymore  
> Then I pause for a moment  
> Then I exhale through the body's mouth until I cannot anymore  
> Then I pause for a moment  
> Then I continue for two to four measures

Avoid the temptation to visualize, think or feel anything. Just let it happen without comment. The first pause is known as the I AM and the second is known as the WE ARE. Continue for as long as your gut says.
    
## Scenario Outline: consolidation

> As a meditatior  
> In order to consolidate things  
> When I notice things bubble up  
> Then I take a fresh look at them  
> And decide what I want to do with them  
> Then I perform $action  
> Then I repeat this for a few minutes  
> Then I use my intuition to guide

Again the numbers are not hard; please play with them and see what works best for you.

### Examples:

| action                          |
| :------------------------------ |
| simple awareness and acceptance |
| loving-kindness (metta)         |
| conflict resolution techniques  |
| appreciation                    |
| compassion                      |
| forgiveness                     |
| humility                        |
| valor                           |
| understanding                   |

## Scenario: meditation session

> As a meditator  
> In order to perform a Quantum Pause session  
> Given I have a comfortable space  
> And I have some time to myself  
> Then I start with the declarative purpose  
> Then I do 2-4 measures of the breathing cycle  
> Then I consolidate  
> Then I repeat the breathing cycle and consolidation a few times  
> Then I thank the session for happening  
> Then I end it
