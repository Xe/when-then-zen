# Paracosm Immersion

A paracosm (also known as a mental wonderland) is a kind of thoughtspace
that you can create, control and immerse yourself into. It is a lot less hard
to create and immerse yourself into than people expect, almost deceptively so.

The method explained in this document is roughly based on [literal philosophical metaphysical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics), or in
simpler terms: to answer the following two questions with as much detail and
as generally as possible.

1. What is _there_?
2. What is _it like_?

The method used here is a combination of a sensory grounding technique and
something I found to help mitigate feelings of aphasia. The parts of this
technique can be thusly taken out of the context of this exercise and used
to either help you ground yourself or for helping you feel like you can 
visualize and experience things better. 

It's really not hard unless you make it hard. Make it easy and it will be 
trivial. I have been noting my progress here: https://write.as/ma-insa/

## Background
 
> Given you have a mental world in mind  
> Or an image of what you would like to experience  
> Or even just a simple idea  
> And are willing to let the sensations of that world overwhelm you  
> And have some time to yourself  
> And you have some writing device 

Feel free to punt on the last part if it's distracting

## Scenario: Picking Somewhere in the Space

> As a visitor of that world  
> In order to get an idea of where you want to go  
> When you pick a place  
> Then keep it in mind as you go forward

## Scenario: Grounding

> As a visitor of that world in the location you picked  
> In order to help ground yourself into that world  
> When you take in the sensations that would make sense for it  
> Then you note five things you can see  
> Then you note four things you can hear  
> Then you note three things you can touch  
> Then you note two things you can smell  
> Then you note one thing you can taste  
> Then you note additional sensory reactions to things as they come into your focus

## Scenario: feature analysis for random things you noted

> As a visitor of that world in the location you picked  
> In order to get more detail in mind about some random thing you noted  
> When you focus on that thing in particular  
> Then you note what group or category that thing is in  
> Then you note what common uses exist for that thing  
> Then you note what inherent actions are common for that thing  
> Then you note what properties that thing has  
> Then you note what the most common location for that thing is  
> Then you note any other associations that come up when thinking about that thing  
> Then you repeat this a few times as makes sense

## Scenario: daily practice

> As someone who wants to immerse in a mental world  
> In order to help train this skill  
> When you are planning your day  
> Then add some time for this practice  
> Then (if it helps) set a timer to help limit your sessions  
> Then pick a place you want to immerse yourself into  
> Then ground yourself in that place  
> Then describe a few things using feature analysis  
> Then (if it helps) put your notes into a blog or diary of some kind

I personally find it helps to do this in the morning, and for up to 30 minutes maximum. Going through my normal routine usually gets me to 30 mintues.
